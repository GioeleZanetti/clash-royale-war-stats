            <h1>Help page</h1>
            <br><br>
            <h6>If you are having any trouble, this page may help you.</h6>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                In this page, I am going to give you some information
                that could help you use this web site
            </p>
            <h6>1. What is this website for?</h6>
            <p>
                Well, this website is meant to analyze your clan War
                in a pretty complete way. It offers you tools to see
                your clan current race and analyze past ones. If you
                want to change the clan that is beeing analyzed, modify
                the clan tag in the configuration file, if you know 
                what you are doing, or ask the website administrator
                to change it for you.
            </p>
            <h6>2. Which pages do what?</h6>
            <p>
                I have prepared some pages for you. Those are:<br><br>
                <span>
                    <a href="#dashboard">2.1. Dashboard</a><br>
                    <a href="#scores">2.2. Scores</a><br>
                    <a href="#help">2.3. Help page</a><br><br>
                </span>
                I will tell you what each page can do.
            </p>
            <h6 id="dashboard">2.1 Dashboard</h6>
            <p>
                This one is the
                one you can see in the game too. It shows you the leaderboard
                as well as your clanmates scores. The ones highlighted in green
                are the ones that are above the minimum threshold of your clan. If
                your clan <b>does not</b> have an established threshold, all of
                the names will be green.
            </p>
            <h6 id="scores">2.2 Scores</h6>
            <p>
                This is the one i like the most. It allows you to see,
                in the races that took place in the past, what you and 
                your clanmates did. There is a graph showing you
                your scores throughout all the races and there is
                your total and average score. Keep in mind that this website
                only allows you to see up to 5 races in the past.
            </p>
            <h6 id="help">2.3 Help page</h6>
            <p>
                Well, is the one you are seeing right now. It gives you some
                info about this whole website.
